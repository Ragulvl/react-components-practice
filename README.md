# React Components Practice

A React learning project focused on practicing fundamental React concepts including JSX, components, component composition, and CSS styling.

## Project Overview

This is a **practice/learning project** (not a production application) that demonstrates:

- **JSX Syntax**: Writing JSX elements and expressions
- **Components**: Creating functional React components
- **Component Composition**: Building an app by combining multiple components
- **CSS Styling**: Applying styles to React components
- **Asset Imports**: Importing and using images in React
- **Folder Structure**: Organizing components in a maintainable structure
